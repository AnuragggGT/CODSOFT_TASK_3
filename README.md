# CODSOFT_TASK_3

🔐 Password Generator Application

This project is a Password Generator built using Python as part of my internship for the CodSoft Virtual Summer Internship Program (June 2025). It helps users create strong and secure passwords by generating random combinations of characters.

The application allows users to:

• 📥 Specify the desired password length

• 🧩 Choose complexity options (uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters)

• 🔁 Generate a random password based on user preferences

• 📋 Display the generated password on the screen for use


🔧 Technologies Used:

•  Python – Core programming language

•  random module – For generating random character combinations

•  tkinter – GUI interface for user interaction (if GUI-based)

•  string module – For accessing character sets
